# aromatic-sulfur-interactions
Python pipeline to analyze cysteine–aromatic interactions in protein structures. Replicates the analysis shown in Figure 4 of: J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2865−2870.  The code downloads PDB files, identifies aromatic ring centers and cysteine sulfurs, calculates distances and angles, checks for steric obstruction, and categorizes interactions.
